# CameraAppbySanjeev

It is Camera APP and I developed it (Here I references to "SANJEEV KUMAR SINGH")

It basically take permission first to use your camera and then
It takes pic when clicked on Capture Photo

Then it shows the photo taken side by side and also generates a link to that taken pic just below
through which 
one can
 download and save that same captured pic to their local drives.

 Thanks for using
